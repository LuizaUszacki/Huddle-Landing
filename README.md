# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section

## About the Website
I created this website as a challenge of FrontEnd Mentor.
To do that, I used HTML and a little bit o Scss (as I learn more, I'll add more Scss to my projects).
It's a responsive project and the screen has some specific width, the image will above the text, otherwise, they'll be beside each other.

## Notes
I tried to develop this website while listening who Coder Coder was doing.
So, there are things that I did different to her, but there was also times when I could learn new things to her.
One example of it is when I was trying to do the mobile layout, but even putting the same padding and margin as in the image, it seemed a lot bigger in my screen.
After struggling a bit if it I heard her saying it was because some designer make the mobile design twice as big as the mobile phone.
